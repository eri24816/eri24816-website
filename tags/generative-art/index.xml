This makes me think of two possible ways converting fractals into sound or music:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given a fractal on a 2d plane, we can view each vertical slice of pixels as a waveform or spectrum and scan over the fractal horizontally to produce a playable audio. It may require the fractal to be a real-valued map (instead of binary).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The waveform option feels more reasonable because it more likely to produce non-uniform characteristics on the sound, such as varying intensities across frequencies. However, it will be tricky to connect each waveform across time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
