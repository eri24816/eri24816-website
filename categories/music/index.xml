&lt;p>After 3 years of training music generation models and interacting with them through CLI, this is my first attempt to build a user interface for them. Playing with it feels really great, it feels like the model is actually usable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has a piano roll where you can make music. When needed, you can ask AI to generate a bar for you. It will offer multiple options for your choice, and you can also edit it. Occasionally, there emerges music that sounds amazingly good but you didn&amp;rsquo;t think of, that kind of accident is the main value of this AI in music composition.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
