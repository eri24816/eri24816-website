I think of two ways converting fractals into sound or music.

Given a fractal on a 2d plane, we can view each vertical slice of pixels as a waveform or spectrum and scan over the fractal horizontally to produce a playable audio. It maybe requires the fractal to be real-

The waveform option feels more reasonable because it more naturally allows characteristics of the sound to be controlled by characteristics of the fractal, such as intensities of various frequency. However, it will be tricky to connect each waveform across time.

Another possibility is reading fractals as symbolic music. We can sample through the fractal in a quantized grid
